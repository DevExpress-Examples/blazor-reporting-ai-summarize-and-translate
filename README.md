# Reporting for Blazor - Integrate AI Assistant based on Azure OpenAI

This example is a Blazor application with integrated DevExpress Reports and an AI assistant. User requests and assistant responses are displayed on-screen using the DevExtreme `dxChat` component.

The AI assistant's role depends on the associated DevExpress Reports component:

- **Data Analysis Assistant**: An assistant for the DevExpress *Document Viewer* and *Native Report Viewer*. This assistant analyzes report content and answers questions related to information within the report.
- **User Interface Assistant**: An assistant for the DevExpress *Report Designer*. This assistant explains how to use the Designer UI to accomplish various tasks. Responses are based on information from [end-user documentation](https://github.com/DevExpress/dotnet-eud) for DevExpress Web Reporting components.

**Please note that AI Assistant initialization takes time. The assistant tab appears once Microsoft Azure scans the source document on the server side.**

## Implementation Details

### Common Settings

#### Add Personal Keys

You need to create an Azure OpenAI resource in the Azure portal to use AI Assistants for DevExpress Reporting. Refer to the following help topic for details: [Microsoft - Create and deploy an Azure OpenAI Service resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal).

Once you obtain a private endpoint and an API key, open [appsettings.json](./CS/DxBlazorApplication1/appsettings.json) and add `Name`, `Key`, and `Url` values to the fields below:

```json
"AISettings": {
	"Name": "",
	"Key": "",
	"Url": ""
}
```

#### Register AI Services

Register AI services in your application. Add the following code to the _Program.cs_ file:

```cs
using DevExpress.AIIntegration;
// ...
builder.Services.AddDevExpressAI((config) => {
    config.RegisterChatClientOpenAIService(new AzureOpenAIClient(
        new Uri(settings.Url),
        new AzureKeyCredential(settings.Key)
        ), settings.Name);
    config.AddBlazorReportingAIIntegration(config => {
        config.SummarizeBehavior = SummarizeBehavior.Abstractive;
        config.AvailabelLanguages = new List<LanguageItem>() {
            new LanguageItem() { Key = "de", Text = "German" },
            new LanguageItem() { Key = "en", Text = "English" }
        };
    });
});
```
