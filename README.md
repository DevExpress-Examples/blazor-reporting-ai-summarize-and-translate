# Reporting for Blazor - Integrate AI Assistant based on Azure OpenAI

This example is a Blazor application with integrated DevExpress Reports and an AI assistant. User requests and assistant responses are displayed on-screen using the DevExtreme `dxChat` component.

The AI assistant's role depends on the associated DevExpress Reports component:

- **Data Analysis Assistant**: An assistant for the DevExpress *Web Document Viewer*. This assistant analyzes report content and answers questions related to information within the report.
- **User Interface Assistant**: An assistant for the DevExpress *Web Report Designer*. This assistant explains how to use the Designer UI to accomplish various tasks. Responses are based on information from [end-user documentation](https://github.com/DevExpress/dotnet-eud) for DevExpress Web Reporting components.

**Please note that AI Assistant initialization takes time. The assistant tab appears once Microsoft Azure scans the source document on the server side.**

> [!NOTE]
